# tiny switch aio pack
This is a tiny AIO pack for my own use. I would HIGHLY reccomend modding your switch with switch.hacks.guide
Tested on Mariko and Erista

FOLLOW THE SWITCH GUIDE. THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR IT!
https://switch.hacks.guide/


Mariko is:
Switch Lite
Switch OLED
V2 Switch

Erista is:
V1 Unpatched
V1 Patched

This pack should be safe from bans, but please read this before proceeding
https://nx.eiphax.tech/ban.html
It is still HIGHLY recommended to create an EmuMMC

Mariko can run significantly faster than Erista. Very few Erista units are patched. Any patched units require a modchip
Modchip guide is at https://switch.hacks.guide/user_guide/modchip/
Please read the guide fully before chipping your consoles
Only Picofly chips are supported (The ones with the chip with the Raspberry on it)
Instinct-NX chips are garbage. Do not buy them.
TX Clone chips are supported, provided they are flashed with open source firmware
Erista can be modded with fuseé geleé exploit.

This contains hekate, Atmosphere
Contains some useful homebrew too
