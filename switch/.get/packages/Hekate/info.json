(GUI option may come later.)\\nThat only disables the ticker for custom bootlogos, not the default hekate one.\\nFor new Mariko users, Auto HOS Power Off feature is now enabled by default\\nExisting users, can enable it, as always, in Nyx -> Options -> Auto HOS Power Off.\\nAdded an error message in case payload launching fails\\nPreviously it wouldn't show anything.\\nSupport for new dram chips\\nMany under the hood improvements\\nNotice about Atmosphere 1.0.0 and up: The fss0=atmosphere/fusee-secondary.bin in hekate_ipl.ini must be changed to fss0=atmosphere/package3.

Check v5.5.4 & Nyx v1.0.0 changelog if you want to learn more.\\n\\n5.5.4\\n\\nBetter user reporting for Mariko Warmboot Storage (MWS) with missing firmware\\nIn case warmboot firmware was not found in MWS cache in SD, it will now notify user that sleep mode will be disabled if continue booting is selected.\\nEKS for Erista now automatically upgrades itself, in order to fix issues with normal vs r2p paths when it was created with old hekate.\\nMain BCT is now checked for improper values before running Sept in Erista\\nBefore, launching Sept in such cases (improper BCT) it would make it black screen.\\nNow an error will show up that instructs user to run sept with proper BCT at least once, in order to cache keys in EKS.\\nFatFS now supports simple GPT\\nIn case you mangled your Hybrid MBR, this will allow you to launch Nyx if FAT partition is the first one.\\nSDSC cards (<= 2GB) are now supported\\nMany other bug fixes and improvements\\n\\n5.5.3\\n\\nFixed an issue with sdmmc driver.

This change doesn't actually affect the user, it just reduces the codesize/complexity of hekate. Also it has nothing to do with actual fuses burnt.)\\nSimplified RAM OC for users that compile an overclocked Minerva library.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\n5.5.1\\n\\nHOS 11.0.1 support\\nFix sleep in modchipped Eristas\\nFirst BCT, that is used in warmboot binary, has improper modulus.

Thanks @shchmue.\\nAdditionally, heap management became more robust and fragments way less often.\\nAdded support for entering fastboot on Android.\\nThis requires of pressing VOL+ first and while holding it, also start holding VOL-.\\nExternal patches only look for patches.ini now\\nThe reason is that patches_template.ini is now useless and no one should install homebrew when title replacement exists.\\nAlso because apparently it confuses users into thinking that it takes precedence over patches.ini, even though it explained countless of times that it's only loaded if patches.ini is not found.\\nLastly there's a confusion where users thought that empty patches is not the same with no patches, even though it's exactly the same.

It's now back to 6s.\\nFixed instant boot to menu (\"bootloop\") on errors. Now hekate will properly wait for user input in order to go back to menu.\\nFixed an issue with tsec keys, where KFUSE didn't have enough time to initialize.\\nFixed an issue where double defined patches (like NOGC), would fail the process.

Packs many features, like FastFS, emuMMC manage, customization, etc.\\nLook below for more.\\n8.1.0 support\\nemuMMC support\\nIt supports disabling it by boot entry (emummc_force_disable=1), stock (not all fw ver support it) and many more.\\nWorks with SD raw partition and SD file based. (SD file based is extremely slow. Wait for FastFS 4 emuMMC).\\nThis version can sanely shutdown and also supports more SD cards than before.\\nThanks to a collab with @m4xw , @SciresM, @hexkyz.\\nSupercharged boot times\\nEven with emuMMC or kip1 patching, it's faster than before.\\nSupercharged Backup/Restore with FastFS (Nyx only)\\nBackup and Restore is now orders of magnitudes faster.\\nSome examples (measured on a U3 SD): No verif: 9min, Sparse: 15min, etc. Even Full with hashes is extremely faster.\\nExternal KIP1 patching support\\nNow non-important patches reside outside of hekate binary. For now this can only patch KIPs defined in hekate's code, with whatever new patches. Next versions will support other KIPs.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\nNyx v0.8.0\\n\\nSnappy and fluid GUI w/ touch support\\nYes! This runs on BPMP!\\nAll classic launch options are there\\nemuMMC manage\\nChange between raw partition emuMMCs and SD file based ones easily.\\nCreate file based or raw partition based from eMMC via the Create button.\\nYou can also restore a backup directly to sd partition via the Restore option in tools (outside of emuMMC), AFTER you turned ON SD emuMMC Raw Partition.\\nMigrate other types of emunand (raw partition or sd file), repair existing raw partition configurations, or migrate a backup (outside of restore folder), to sd file based.\\nEverything is currently made to protect Linux partitions.\\nAdditionally, the raw partition based is done in 16MB offset, so it can protected from quick formats.\\nAll Info and Tools are now supercharged\\nDump individual kips from eMMC, see detailed info about fuses, do backups and restores way faster, etc.\\nCustomization support\\nCustom icons for boot entries and also a background is supported.

Please check readme.md for more\\nAuto NoGC\\nIt checks fuses and applies the patch automatically if higher firmware.\\nIt is now a global config and set on auto by default. (0: Disabled, 1: Auto)\\nFixed a bug with ini list, where it would hang when using wildcard * with kip1=.\\nQuality of life fixes under the hood, that ease user's life.\\nAs always many bug fixes and some refactoring.\\nBacklog from v4.6svc beta:\\n\\nsvcControlCodeMemory patches that helps dynarec on emulators.\\nFixed sleep mode with debug mode when official 6.X.X secmon is used\\nAdded RTC driver which now also disables wake up alarm when Auto HOS Power Off is used\\nHelps when users that use AutoRCM inject and power off pretty fast.\\nFixed GPU on Linux when booting from warmboot\\nAdded missing fallback auto calibration of sd cards and plus some small fixes.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\nv4.6svc\\n\\nNew in this BETA\\nAdded patch for svcControlCodeMemory that helps dynarec on emulators.\\nFixed sleep mode when debug mode is on and official 6.X.X secmon is used\\nAdded RTC driver which now also disables wake up alarm when Auto HOS Power Off is used\\nHelps when users that use AutoRCM inject and power off pretty fast.\\nFixed GPU on Linux when booting from warmboot\\nAdded missing fallback auto calibration of sd cards and plus some small fixes.\\nNOTE: You can get the other files (lp0 library) from a previous release.\\n\\nv4.6\\n\\nThis version supports booting ALL current OS/CS CFW, Linux chainloading and payload tools.\\nNo more SD card removals\\n\\nLatest OFW supported: 6.2.0\\n\\nNew in this version\\nFixed sleep for downgraded units with efuses burnt more than required.\\nFixed update.bin chainloading and also forced hw init on update, in case it changes again in the future.\\nThis is a breaking fix and requires to have v4.6 to your modchip/dongle.\\nNew archive bit fix\\nIt can now also fix the Nintendo folder. No more \"corrupted\" sd when upgrading sd card or restoring Nintendo folder.\\nFixed UART debug printing. Thanks @hyln9\\nAuto HOS power is now disabled by default. Probably, most people learned what it does and can enable it from the Options menu.\\nSome small SMMU emulation for TSEC fixes for the unluckiest out there. Max wait time remains small.\\nMany many many fixes and also added some error msgs for restore and boot options.\\nNOTE: Everything hekate related, moved to bootloader folder.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nv4.5\\n\\nFull 6.2.0 support.

Thanks @hexkyz for taking the time to investigate.\\nEvery file lister is now ignoring hidden files and .dot files. Thanks @StevenMattera\\nThe Minerva Training Cell library for hekate was updated to latest version (v1.1)\\nAdded \"silent option to Auto HOS power off option. You can now choose if you want the logo to be shown. Thanks @Huntereb\\nRefactored the monolithic main.c to simpler grouped sections. Additionally hos.c took some love.\\nMany many bugfixes\\nNOTE: Everything hekate related, moved to bootloader folder.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nv4.2:\\n - Support \"*\" folder wildcard in kip1 key\\n   Using <folder>/* can now parse and load all kip and kip1 files inside that folder.\\n - Add option to enable/disable Auto HOS power off\\n   If you do not use a modchip/dongle, Options->Auto HOS power off to disable.\\n - Allow canceling of the verification process\\n   Now you can cancel backup and verification process. If backup phase is done, canceling in verification, will keep your files.\\n - Some small bugfixes and support certain cfw on its stock version\\n\\nv4.1:\\n - Full 6.0.0 support\\n - Improved .ini/payload handling\\n - PWM backlight\\n - Auto full power off when the device woke up from HOS power off\\n   Usefull with modchips/dongles when using AutoRCM.
