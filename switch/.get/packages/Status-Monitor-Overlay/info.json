  "details": "Monitor Your hardware in real time!\\n\\nThis is an overlay homebrew dedicated to Nintendo Switch. You need to have installed Tesla environment to use it.\\n\\nTool contains three modes to choose, each one is explained here : https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay/blob/master/docs/modes.md\\n\\nYou can exit from selected mode by pressing and holding Left Stick + Right Stick. To exit from main menu press B.\\n\\nIf it's not working in dock, you need to first start Status Monitor, then put Nintendo Switch to dock.\\n\\nWhat is currently supported:\\n\\nCPU Usage for each core (Cores #0-#2 are used by apps/games, Core #3 is used by OS, background processes and also Tesla overlays)\\nGPU Load\\nCPU, GPU & RAM actual frequency\\nUsed RAM categorized to: (not supported by FWs <5.0.0)\\nTotal\\nApplication\\nApplet\\nSystem\\nSystem Unsafe\\nSoC, PCB & Skin temperatures (Skin temperature not supported by FWs <5.0.0)\\nFan Rotation Level\\nPFPS and FPS (with help of NX-FPS, more info in repo. Not installing it results in not showing FPS counters on overlay)\\nPlanned:\\nAdd Graph mode\\n\\nRequirements:\\n\\nFrom 0.4.1 you need Tesla Menu >=1.0.2\\n\\nThanks to:\\n\\nRetroNX channel for helping with coding stuff\\nSunTheCourier for sys-clk-Overlay from which I learned how to make my own Tesla homebrew\\nHerbaciarz for providing screenshots from HDMI Grabber\\nFAQ:\\nQ: This homebrew has any impact on games?\\n\\nA: Negligible, you won't see any difference. Almost everything is done on Core #3, other cores usage is below 0.001%.\\n\\nTroubleshooting:\\nQ: Game sometimes hangs when using Status Monitor Overlay. Why?\\n\\nA: This is because of dmnt:cht nature. Some games don't like that it's peaking constantly at its memory and they stuck. This happens only if you are using NX-FPS plugin. Solution is to just close Status Monitor Overlay (you don't need to close Tesla Menu) and wait few seconds until game will resume.",
  "changelog": "1.1.3\\n\\nSwitch reading fan rotation level from \"fan\" service to \"pwm\" service\\nThis allows avoiding potential conflict with other homebrew/sysmodules (f.e. Nx-FanControl) because only one process can have fan controller session in \"fan\" service.\\n\\n1.1.2\\n\\nFix Resolutions sometimes going out of bounds in Full Mode\\nUpdate SaltyNX to 0.9.2+ for better compatibility with games using Id Tech engines and Creation Engine\\n\\n1.1.1\\n\\nAdded options to show 2 the best candidates for game's internal resolution in Mini and Full modes.\\nAdded keys to config that can disable showing FPS and Resolutions in Full mode\\nAdded value RES to show key in Mini mode that shows Resolutions.\\nUpdate SaltyNX to 0.9.1+ for better compatibility with games using Id Tech engines\\n\\n1.1.0\\n\\nAdded \"Game Resolutions\" menu to \"Other\" category. More HERE.\\n\\nSaltyNX 0.9.0+ is required for it to work properly\\n\\n1.0.4\\n\\nMoved from c++20 to c++23\\nWith SaltyNX 0.8.0+ FPS Graph mode will adjust height according to received back display refresh rate.\\n\\n1.0.3a\\n\\nFix compability issues with combos from Ultrahand and Tesla configs after implementing #72\\n\\n1.0.3\\n\\nImproved key combo and navigation handling #72 (thanks to @IrneRacoonovich )\\nFixed an issue with battery readings not working after exiting Micro mode multiple times without rebooting Switch (this bug affected also other homebrew reading battery stats with PSM service)\\nFutureproofed for sys-clk IPC updates\\n\\n1.0.2\\n\\nAdd new keys to config: battery_avg_iir_filter and battery_time_left_refreshrate, more in CONFIG\\nChanging battery_avg_iir_filter to true results in period time of average voltage being changed to 45s, and 11.25s for amperage\\nRemoved whole logic behind PR #56 instead relying now on max17050 TTE register\\nChanged i2c communication code to avoid issues with wrong readings (thanks to ~lineon)\\nMove FPS Graph and FPS Counter to one subcategory \"FPS\"\\n\\n1.0.1\\n\\nAllow hiding real frequencies, deltas and target frequencies in Full mode (deltas are not showed if both real + target frequencies are hidden).\\n\\nThis release also includes 2 shadow updates for 1.0.0, which includes fixes for overflowing of real frequencies + deltas, and also fixed RAM positioning calculations in Micro and Mini modes.\\n\\n0.9.2\\n\\n17.0.0 FW issues fixed:\\n\\nSoC and PCB temperatures showing 0\\nCharger Type, Charger Max Voltage and Charger Max Current showing wrong values\\nGeneral changes:\\n\\nSoC and PCB temperatures across all FWs are now showing decimals\\nNext to Battery Power Draw in Full, Mini and Micro modes you can see now also estimated time left before Switch will shutdown (thanks to rkuchkarov for PR #56)\\nIn Micro instead of MB for RAM now you will see GB up to one decimal\\nIn Micro now power draw shows only one decimal\\nFan level will now render only one decimal across all modes\\nMiscellaneous now also shows NVENC and NVJPG clocks (thanks to averne for PR #57)\\nSince 17.0.0 audsnoop is not available, DSP Usage is not shown in Other -> Miscellaneous tab\\n\\n0.9.1\\n\\nNow filepath for Micro mode is not hardcoded, it is retrieved via Tesla Menu.\\n\\nTo use it with changed filename it is required to update Tesla Menu to version at least 1.2.3.\\nOn older versions of Tesla Menu it behaves the same as 0.9.0 version.\\n\\n0.9.0\\n\\nCorrected Battery Power Flow calculation\\nChanged Battery Stats reading to 2 readings per second. Current, Voltage and Power Flow are calculated now via 10 last readings.\\nChanged FPS average calculation to 10 last readings instead of constant averaging\\nAdded Graphs tab with currently only FPS available (Graphs tab won't show for now if you don't have SaltyNX installed)\\nMoved Battery/Charger + Miscellaneous tabs under \"Other\" tab\\nYou can move now FPS Counter + FPS Graph to the bottom and top of screen by pressing ZR + R + D-Pad Down/Up\\n\\n0.8.3\\n\\nAdd Battery Power Flow stat into Full, Mini, Micro modes and Battery/Charger tab\\nAdd Battery Current Flow into Battery/Charger tab\\nChange Battery Voltage from 45s average to average of 5 to match better with Battery Current Flow and get faster responses to changes in voltage at the cost of slightly less accurate readings\\nFix a random issue with allocing memory for reading Wi-Fi password and battery stats\\n\\n0.8.2\\n\\nFix conditional handle leak\\nFix memory leak\\nWorkaround race condition causing random crashes in docked mode\\n\\n0.8.1\\n\\nMove reading FPS from dmnt:cht to SharedMemory. This fixes any stutterings, thread desyncing and cracking sounds you may have encountered when using NX-FPS in games.\\n\\nRequires NX-FPS 0.4+ and SaltyNX 0.5.0+ to read FPS.\\n\\n0.7.1\\n\\nIt adds support for 16.0.0.\\n\\n0.7\\n\\nNew 2 tabs were added:\\n\\nBattery/Charger\\nMiscellaneous\\nYou can now check Battery temperature, max supported charger voltage and current, connected Wi-Fi password and few others.\\n\\n0.6.4\\n\\nAdded support for 14.0.0 FW.\\nIt removed function for reading SoC and PCB temperatures in milli Celsius. 0.6.3 was outputting 0.0C because of that. Now it reads temperature in Celsius without decimals on FW 14.0.0+\\nFixed slow boot time by reimplementing fix from Breeze repository\\n\\n0.6.3\\n\\nFixed button combo\\n\\n0.6.1\\n\\nFix issue related to always forcing opening cheat process with dmnt:cht that sometimes resulted in conflicts with other tools.\\nNow it's checking first if cheat process is opened already.\\n\\n\\n0.6.0\\n\\nIf dmnt:cht is not detected, it's using svc calls to read FPS values for NX-FPS (now only if SaltyNX check failed, FPS Counter won't show).\\nBe aware that not using Atmosphere's dmnt:cht may introduce conflicts with other cheat engines, resulting in crashes or hangs.\\n\\n0.5.4\\n\\nFix issue with CPU Core usage stuck at last value when core usage is at peak.\\n\\n0.5.3\\n\\nUpdated to libnx 3.2.0, which helps with very rare case of crashing overlay if pl sessions are depleted.\\nFixed wrong version inside overlay\\n\\n0.5.2\\n\\nAdded version info for Tesla menu\\nAdded support for SX OS (FPS Counter is not available)"
