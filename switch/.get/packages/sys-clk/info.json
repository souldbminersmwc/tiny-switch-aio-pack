A list of games title id can be found in Switchbrew wiki.\\n\\nFrequencies are expressed in mhz, and will be scaled to the nearest possible values, described in the clock table below.\\n\\nIf any key is omitted, value is empty or set to 0, it will be ignored.",
  "changelog": "2.0.0-rc\\n\\nsys-clk does not embed freq tables anymore, and will now get them from HOS at boot time\\nReal/instant frequencies, and battery power draw can now be printed in the overlay, manager, logs, and csv reports\\nNew GPU Max on handheld for Mariko: 614Mhz\\nSupport for HOS 17.0.0 has been added\\n\\n1.0.3\\n\\nThis minor update fixes the overlay not working on HOS >= 16.0.0 by upgrading libtesla and libnx to the latest version\\n\\nThanks to @alula for the PR\\n\\n1.0.2\\n\\nThis minor update mainly fixes a sysmodule crash that happens when trying to poll temperatures on HOS >= 14.0.0.\\n\\nBecause one of the method to get precise temperatures was removed, it also means that starting HOS 14 you will no longer have decimal precision on \"PCB\" and \"SOC\" temperatures.\\n\\n1.0.1\\n\\nMinor bugfix release to squash the issues that have been pending for a while, and allow sys-clk to be compiled on libnx 4.0.x\\n\\nFix skin temp not shown in the manager\\nFix Korean characters shown incorrectly in the manager\\nlibtesla upstream sync (libnx 4.0.x compat)\\n\\n1.0.0\\n\\nThis release marks the first 1.x version, and introduces 2 new ways to view and edit the config:\\n\\nHomebrew app: sys-clk manager, testing grounds of borealis, a new hardware accelerated, Nintendo Switch inspired UI library for PC and Nintendo Switch\\nTesla overlay: sys-clk-overlay, powered by libtesla\\nFeatures\\nEnable/disable sys-clk\\nDisplay the frequencies, thermals, and profile retrieved from the sysmodule\\nList and edit application profiles for either:\\nYour installed apps on the manager\\nThe currently running app directly in the overlay\\nEdit advanced settings such as timings and temporary frequencies overrides\\n\\n0.13.1\\n\\nThis hotfix update aims to address the shortage of time sessions that could trigger fatals from using Homebrew if too many sysmodules were running.\\n\\nChanges:\\n\\nDon't keep the time session open (only used at init)\\nMisc changes from the develop branch (libnx compat, etc) that does not affect features\\n\\n0.13.0\\n\\nTemperature monitoring (SoC; PCB and Skin at customizable interval)\\nLogging refactor:\\nLogs can now be enabled or disabled at runtime\\nPrettier logs (clock hz format, shorter text)\\nMilliseconds in timestamp\\nCSV export (timestamp, titleId, profile, clocks, temps at customizable interval)\\nFW 9.0.0 fixes\\nHB and crashed apps fixes\\nCheck the readme on how to setup the new config options.\\n\\n\\n\\n0.12.3\\n\\nThis is a minor update that changed polling timings to accommodate actively scaling titles (ex: BOTW, DOOM...)\\n\\n0.12.2\\n\\nThis release adds support for 8.0.0.\\n\\n0.12.1\\n\\nThis hotfix was made to correct the capping logic that was incorrectly applied to the CPU, consequently underclocking on defined profiles.\\n\\n0.12.0\\n\\nConfig loading has been refactored to permit more profile storage, and serve as the groundwork for what's to come\\nThe kip target (which had become irrelevant) and the code required to support it has been removed, consequently enabling pm late loading with no side-effect\\n\\n0.11.1\\n\\nfixes some games running slower than they should be\\n\\n0.11\\n\\nAdds timestamp and version to logs\\nGames and profile changes now always trigger a reset to stock values, even for games that would not change clocks on their own\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n-Added charging profiles\\n-General fixes"
