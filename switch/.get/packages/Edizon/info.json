  "details": "This fork is based on the foundation of EdiZon 3.1 nightly. The changes made are on the game memory hack aspect.\\n\\nHere are the added features:\\n\\nRange search.\\nCompare with previous value search.\\nBookmark memory location found.\\nSpeed enhancement to make small integer value in first search practicle.\\nBookmark adjust to changing main and heap start address on subsequent launch of the game. Bookmark with pointer chain attached updates memory address dynamically when the chain is able to resolve into a valid memory address.\\nExtract memory address from dmnt cheat code and add it to bookmark for exploration of the memory location.\\nRebase feature to extract potential pointer chain form dmnt cheat code made for previous version of the game.\\nIn app pointer chain search for address on bookmark.\\nExport dump to PC app (forked from pointersearcher 0.4) for more powerful pointer chain search.\\nImport PC app search result for validation and testing.\\nCreate dmnt cheat code from pointer chain found.\\nAbility to detach dmnt from game process.\\nAdding/Removing conditional button to cheat code.\\nPS: Please refer to https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE/wiki for instructions on how to use the app.\\n\\nTo establish common base for support please start from a clean boot with the latest atmosphere and only Sigpatches needed to run the game and latest releases from https://github.com/tomvita. Please state the url you downloaded from. No extra software unless it is related to the topic underdiscussoin.\\n\\nOriginal functinality of Edizon on game save is available when launched without a game running.\\n\\nMore Info here : https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE\\n\\n\\n",
  "changelog": "3.8.37\\n\\nVery minor change, fixed LED stop working for HOS16\\nNow player two controller can also control EdiZon\\n\\n3.8.36\\n\\nKey hints is place on the cheat code label, instead of only showing up in Edizon SE now it will show on all cheat managers.\\n\\n3.8.35\\n\\nFixed a pointer chain navigation bug.\\nShow segment and module information in memory explorer.\\nAdd bookmark from cheat now works on pointer that isn't currently valid.\\nAdd bookmark from cheat now supports negative offset.\\nFixed a bug in button display string.\\n\\n3.8.34\\n\\nComparison between number that involve negative number was wrong for anything that isn't 64bit. Now it is fixed for 32bit number. (16 bit and 8 bit number not fixed).\\n\\nFor f32 R now also swap Value1 and Value2 in addition to negating them\\n\\n3.8.29\\n\\nAdded \"DiffBA\" search mode. Use Dpad down on search tab to cycle to this search mode.\\nThis search is used to find unknown value of type u32 or f32 that you can make to change the same amount. Find u32 and f32 candidates that inc or dec with the same amount of change. ( 4 in 1 )\\nStart search with \"SAME\", change the amount, search with \"NotA\", change the amount, search with \"DiffBA\", repeat ( change the amount, search with \"DiffBA\" ) until you have a short list of candidates.\\n\\nFixed a bug with unknown search.\\n\\n3.8.25g\\n\\nThis release is only tested on atmosphere 1.2.4.\\n\\nTo enable gdbstub add the this line to /atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini under [atmosphere]\\nenable_standalone_gdbstub = u8!0x1\\nRestart Switch after the change.\\nThis release will also load dmnt ( CheatVM ) as a sysmodule when GDB is enabled.\\nOnly either dmnt or GDB can be attached to the game at any one time.\\nUse ZL+B to detach dmnt ( and the \"no auto attach\" setting enabled if you are using profile to launch edizon se )\\nDetach GDB from game (method will depend on GDB client) and reattach dmnt with ZL+B to have access to CheatVM again.\\n\\nAdded ASCII display to memory explorer. Added bit mask for single value search.\\n\\nUse dmp0 and allow button swap for jump back. Jump back data will be using dmp0 so it won't overwrite dump file meant for pointer search. If you don't understand what this means don't worry, it has no impact to you.\\n\\nWhen all cheats are deleted edizon se will exit instead of crash.\\n\\n3.8.24\\n\\nWith atmosphere 20 you can press ZL+B to ask dmnt to detach from the game. There very few games that does not work well with dmnt attached but if you happen to be playing those games you can ask dmnt to detach when you are done using it to hack the game. ( Remember to turn off auto attach or the next time edizon se launch dmnt will be attached ).\\n\\nWith atmosphere 20 it is now possible to support dynamic loading of master code. Now when you place a cheat file containing master code in edizon\\cheats it will be loaded correctly when you launch edizon se.\\n\\n3.8.20\\n\\nValue pair search can be activated by pressing + twice on search memory value tab. [ A,B ] indicates that you are in value pair mode.\\nQuite often some values are next to each other, for example HP and HP MAX or MP and MP MAX are very frequently next to each other.\\nIn this mode the two value you enter at this screen will be match with memory locations that has these two value next to each other.\\nLet's say you see your HP as 12/21 you may want to try searching for 12, 21 or 21, 12.\\n\\n3.8.17\\n\\nSysmodule manager will offer to help create system_settings.ini if there isn't one.\\n\\n3.8.16\\n\\nMany users have too many sysmodules running causing system stability problem for them.\\nThis version included sysmodule manager ported from hekate toolbox and extended to list all sysmodules including those without\\ntoolbox.json file, such sysmodule will be named according to the title id and mark as required reboot. You can edit the toolbox.json\\nfile created by EdiZon SE to get a better name and test the sysmodule to see if it really requires reboot.\\n\\nAdded two optional module in the zip. Now Noexs sysmodule and profile forwarder is included (they are disabled by default, use sysmodule manager to enable them).\\n\\nProfile forwarder let you launch edizon se using profile which saves a few seconds from needing to launch hbmenu.\\n\\nNoexs sysmodule let you do dump for PC pointer searching over wifi.\\n\\n3.8.15\\n\\nOpcode bounds check bug fix, mark search bug fix, clear search bug fix.\\n\\n3.8.14\\n\\nFix temporary expert mode enable cause crash when there was no cheats\\n\\n3.8.11\\n\\nChange LED behavior during memory search.\\n\\nSome games are using Alias instead of Heap. Now Alias is indicated in the main display for these games for awareness.\\n\\nAlias is functionally the same as heap for memory search performed by EdiZon SE. However it is a different entity as far as SVC (Nintendo Switch's system calls) is concerned. Currently alias as a memory region is not supported in cheat code type 0, 1 and 5.\\n\\nAdding a memory relative to alias_extend.base as a code (ZL+A on a bookmark without pointer chain) won't work unless you use the attached forked dmnt (for 18.1 only).\\nThis fork added option for Alias to code type 0, 1 and 5.\\nM: Memory region to write to (0 = Main NSO, 1 = Heap, 2 = Alias).\\nChange request to have this in official dmnt is rejected. So use such code for own amusement only.\\n\\nI notice many new games are using alias recently but I have not found memory I want to hack that is static relative to alias_extend.base. At the moment it is just nice to be able to quickly bind memory hack to a key press for testing purpose. Static (relative to main, heap, alias) memory is rare, theoretically I see no reason why static relative to heap should be more common than static relative to alias. I think the need is real just not immediate.\\n\\n3.8.10\\n\\nNow no need to relaunch for new code to take effect. Code updates works immediately.\\n\\nIf you are developing code on a PC you can put your new [buildid].txt in \\switch\\edizon\\cheats for it to be loaded and ready for the game that is currently running.\\n\\nChange in P status display in memory explorer.\\nEach bit in P shows the potential to reach main in x back jump with offset no more than max P range.\\nbit0 9, bit1 8, bit2 7, bit3 6, bit4 5, bit5 4, bit6 3, bit7 2.\\n\\n3.8.09\\n\\nFor easy mode if cheat exist it will not be automatically overwritten when a different one is available in the database. To overwrite existing cheat press + key on the main screen.\\n\\nFixed a bug where cheat code file would be renamed to .old even when there isn't a cheat code available from cheat database when replacing cheat with file from database is enabled\\n\\nChanged the bit ordering of P (See release note of 3.8.08). It is now reversed for better run time efficiency in pointer search.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.8.04\\n\\nNow you can Rstick click on a memory in memory explorer to help setup multi target search for this memory target.\\n\\n3.7.24\\n\\nEasy mode for people who only want to use code created by others.\\nNo more confusing options and complex key combinations. For people who only want to use cheat codes you now have a\\nfull turn key solution from cheat code download to usage. Just enable the codes and enjoy.\\nPS: Do not enable expert option and it will be easy as pie.\\n\\n3.7.21\\n\\nBookmark added with \"+\" create an entry in BMDump.dat. This file will be use for bookmark import for newer version of pointersearcher SE.\\nThis change reduce potential clutter created by imported bookmarks. Having EdiZon SE running no longer block bookmark import.\\n\\nNeed to update pointersearcher SE to 0.5.9\\nNeed to update noexs sysmodule to 152\\n\\n3.7.18\\n\\nAdded short cut to set search mode. Now you can change mode and continue your search faster.\\nAdded option to use range on unknown search. Default. Set option for old behavior.\\nAdded option to freeze game while applet is activated. Not default. Set option to enable.\\nLimit to one search per session. More than one can cause problem, now it is disabled.\\nFix a bug that crash switch when \"Y\" is pressed when icon is blank.\\n\\n3.7.17\\n\\nFor Super Mario™ 3D All-Stars when one of the game is running the title id seen by cheat gui is not the same as the one use with game save. This cause the game save to not show up when last played game save is suppose to show up in earlier release.\\n\\nGame with unsupported save type ( for example Animal Crossing™: New Horizons ) will be reported as not found with a different error message. Relaunching will display all game saves instead of staying at the not found screen.\\n\\nProvided option to opt for all game save to be displayed all the time. To enable create /switch/EdiZon/showallsaves.txt.\\n\\nPS: Showing only the save of last game cheat gui saw is intended feature. For user with many game saves showing all game saves makes locating the one being worked on a chore. I understand some user would prefer to see all game save and now you have that option.\\n\\n3.7.16\\n\\nI missed one file directory redirect in the code for unknown value search. This cause unknown value search to stuck if the data directory is not the default one.\\n\\n3.7.15\\n\\nfixed dark theme has no contrast in option screen selection\\n\\n3.7.14\\n\\nAdded clear all bookmark option.\\nImproved search mode help text.\\nImproved button hints.\\nChanged key to add bookmark to code.\\nDisplay search config on main screen.\\nAllow change of type for candidate display.\\n\\n3.7.13\\n\\nUpdate about screen to show latest release info.\\nAdded a button on config screen to go to about screen.\\nChanged config file name to seconfig so there won't be problem with older version\\n\\nsnapshot\\n\\nThis build could be unstable, you may install and use it at your own risk.\\nso 3.0.1 is still included in this release along side the snapshot update.\\n\\n3.0.1\\n\\nEdiZon has a new and beautiful icon by kardch!\\nFixed stack overflow when too many addresses were found\\nRenamed Edit RAM to Cheats\\n\\n3.0.0\\n\\nCheat engine like RAM editor!\\nFreezing of variables in RAM using dmnt:cht. Only works with Atmosphère, not with other CFWs!\\nCheat management tool for Atmosphère's dmnt:cht. Only works with Atmosphère, not with other CFWs!\\nReimplemented the auto updater. This is a breaking change! You need to update to this release manually.\\n    Now updates configs, scripts AND cheats!\\nFixed and greatly improved the uploading of save files.
