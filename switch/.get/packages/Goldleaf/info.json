  "details": "Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch\\n\\nIf you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.\\nBrief description\\nGoldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,\\n\\nYou can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.\\n\\nIf you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nInstalling NSP packages can be dangerous.\\n\\nKeep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.\\n\\nIf you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.\\n\\nGoldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.\\n\\nGoldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.\\n\\nThis can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.\\n\\nRemoving tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)\\n\\nMain features\\nSD card and NAND browser\\n\\nA very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:\\n\\nNSP (Nintendo Submission Package)\\n\\nIt's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.\\n\\nTechnically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).\\n\\nGoldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.\\n\\nAs a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.\\n\\nNRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)\\n\\nOfficially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.\\n\\nHomebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.\\n\\nNCA (Nintendo Content Archive)\\n\\nThis format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.\\n\\nWhile the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.\\n\\nNCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.\\n\\nSome NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.\\n\\nNCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.\\n\\nAppart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...\\n\\nGoldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.\\n\\nNXTheme (Home Menu theme)\\n\\nThis format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.\\n\\n+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.\\n\\nYou will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.\\n\\nNACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)\\n\\nThis is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.\\n\\nGoldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.\\n\\nTickets and certificates\\n\\nTickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).\\n\\nNSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.\\n\\nTo install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)\\n\\nThe NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.\\n\\nUSB installer and Goldtree\\n\\nYou can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.\\n\\nTitle manager\\n\\nGoldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.\\n\\nYou can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.\\n\\nTitles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.\\n\\nTicket manager\\n\\nGoldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.\\n\\nYou can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.\\n\\nTickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.\\n\\nCFW configuration\\n\\nThis is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.\\n\\nYou can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.\\n\\nConsole information\\n\\nOn this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.\\n\\nIt also displays the current firmware version the console is.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nDisplays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.\\n\\nAs some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.\\n\\nProviding keys\\nIf you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)\\n\\nUnless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.\\n\\nYou have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.\\n\\nGoldtree and USB installs\\nUSB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.\\n\\nGoldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.\\n\\nBasic controls\\nThe controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:\\n\\nPress A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)\\n\\nPress B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.\\n\\nPress X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.\\n\\nPress Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)\\n\\nMovement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.\\n\\nSpecial features\\nGoldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:\\n\\nGoldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.\\n\\nGoldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.\\n\\nGoldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.\\n\\nIssues and support\\nIn case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.\\n\\nMany errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:\\n\\nIt's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)\\n\\nThe USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install. If that happens, try closing Goldleaf and Goldtree, uninstalling the wrongly-installed title and retrying.",
  "changelog": "v1.0.0\\n\\nNSP installs have been (finally) made multithreaded - I've personally noticed up to 25% faster install times, but this speedups might be even greater ;)\\n\\nProper support for multi-program titles was added (for installing, browsing and exporting them correctly)\\n\\nSwitched to an alternative result system via arc, so that now more system results have proper names/descriptions for more readability\\n\\nImproved various internal parts via caching or general optimizations\\n\\nAdded support to check titles with no data (archived content, gamecard titles without the gamecard inserted, actually corrupted content, etc.)\\n\\nExtended keyboard support, now supporting other kinds of characters (particularly fixed support for account renaming)\\n\\nFixed an annoying ticket/cert exporting bug which caused invalid NSP exports being generated\\n\\nNow one can mount and explore homebrew NROs' RomFs\\n\\nUpdated some language translations (thanks a lot to all the people who frequently help with that <3)\\n\\nAdded support for 12h/24h time display and configuration\\n\\nSupport for NXThemes was removed\\n\\nAdded a setting to allow custom NSP installation copy buffer sizes\\n\\nSlightly improved random UI color generation\\n\\nFixed menu scrollbars behaving incorrectly in menus with too many items\\n\\nFixed a bug where one could exit Goldleaf in the middle of installing NSPs, copying files, etc.\\n\\nImproved the file/directory copy menu and content export menu UIs\\n\\nAdded a setting to disable showing hidden files/directories (those starting by '.' in their name)\\n\\nNow showing a deletion dialog after a NSP install is disabled by default, and a setting was added to enable/disable it\\n\\nv0.10.1\\n\\nFixed a bug where the location of multiple NSP installs would be incorrectly selected\\n\\nContent menu navigation was improved (exiting doesn't suddenly go back to the main menu, etc.)\\n\\nAdded support for Traditional Chinese\\n\\nUpdated key generation information (for latest system versions)\\n\\nContent menu options are properly set now: gamecard contents have proper options now, and other fixes/improvements in option code\\n\\nDumping is now referred to as exporting, and exported contents now go inside /export instead of /dump\\n\\nAdded menu for Goldleaf's own settings, currently only supporting selecting custom language support and ignoring required firmware versions on content installs\\n\\nAmiibo dumping has been improved, now allowing to dump the amiibo's application area (game savedata) if it exists, and its mii in the legacy 3DS format.\\n\\nRedesigned ticket menu (now all tickets, even used ones, are shown), added support for exporting them\\n\\nFixed a bug where cancelling URL text input when browsing a web page would attempt to open the web browser anyway\\n\\nAdded support for language-specific icons in NSP installs, so that now Goldleaf attempts to find and show the icon corresponding to Goldleaf's language (which is by default the system language)\\n\\nFixed invalid/nonsense \"game played since\" values\\n\\nv0.10\\n\\nUpdated for latest libusbhsfs/Plutonium changes, this last one probably means some UI bugs may have been fixed\\nWhen browsing a webpage, the selected user is used\\nSome improvements on the text/hex reader, which is now slightly faster\\nNew supported languages: Japanese, Portuguese, Brazilian, Simplified Chinese, Korean\\nGlobal and user title playstats are shown instead of just user ones (when a user is selected)\\nSelected images on the file browser are now shown on the options dialog, as a preview\\nSupport added for some recent installable contents (known as \"sparse\" contents)\\nOther various bug fixes\\n\\nv0.9\\n\\nI know, I know, it's been a while...\\n\\nGeneral\\nSimplified directory deleting logic for both Goldleaf and Quark, making everything less slower (thanks @pheki)\\nGoldleaf\\nIntroducing savedata browsing! select a game from the game manager menu, and mount it's savedata. Note that, if you forget to unmount them manually, they will be automatically unmounted when Goldleaf is exited\\n\\nSupport for firmware installing, via Atmosphere's ams:su service extension!\\n\\nNow fatal crashes are avoided, and Goldleaf will just display an error message via the console's error applet, and save its own report with information about the crash/error.\\n\\nSimplified and cleaned a lot of internal code, hopefully making everything more stable\\n\\nUpdated libnx and Plutonium - this implies support for previously unsupported special text (Japanese and Chinese characters, etc.) with last Plutonium\\n\\nRemoved emuiibo manager - emuiibo's overlay is now the optimal and recommended manager for emuiibo\\n\\nAmiibo dumping support was updated to match emuiibo's format\\n\\nNon-lowercase file extensions (.TXT, .biN, .Nsp, etc.) are now properly supported\\n\\nFixed resetting a title's launch version, which wasn't properly implemented on previous releases\\n\\nNow dumped firmware will be compatible with Atmosphere's Daybreak firmware tool, deprecating Choi support (as Daybreak is a better and safer alternative)\\n\\nRemoved support for dumping firmware as NSP packages, as no relevent firmware tool makes use of that format\\n\\nReboot-to-payload functionality (which can be used with .bin files) has been internally improved with Atmosphere's bpc:ams extensions\\n\\n🌈 Random color schemes/pallets are used by default now, instead of default light/dark blue schemes\\n\\nFixed a small bug where no personalized tickets would be detected if no common tickets were present in the console\\n\\nIntroducing USB drive support, thanks to me and DarkMatterCore's new project: libusbhsfs, a library to include USB drive support in your homebrew projects!\\n\\nBoth FAT (including exFAT) and NTFS filesystems are supported ;)\\nOther minor code improvements or small bug fixes\\n\\nv0.8\\n\\nGeneral\\nUpdated to latest libnx. This simplifies the code, and fixes potential issues? old libnx could have had.\\n\\nSome parts of the code were rewritten or simplified, in order to try to improve Goldleaf's performance. A lot of nonsense or unused code was removed, and much stuff was simplified thanks to latest libnx changes.\\n\\nRemoved forwarder support. There are less ban-baity ways to launch homebrew as applications (via uLaunch or using Atmosphere's title override)\\n\\nApplication\\nFixed a bug where deleting the currently selected user would leave Goldleaf in a buggy state (because it would still think that the user is valid)\\n\\nNow amiibo dumping is done via \"debug\" amiibo/NFP services. Since emuiibo intercepts user (and soon system) services, using debug services means Goldleaf will be able to dump real amiibos even if emuiibo is activated.\\n\\nCustom exception/crash handling: now, when a crash happens (usually segmentation faults), it won't cause a fatal error, Goldleaf will instead save a simple crash report to /reports and exit normally. Same thing for fatal crashes, which also log fatal reports there.\\n\\nNow rebooting will reboot to RCM/payload, same way as if you rebooted from HOME menu's power menu.\\n\\nThe web browser system was improved, adding now a custom menu, and the possibility to save a page as a bookmark after having browsed it.\\n\\nAdded an integrated emuiibo v0.4.0 manager! This simplifies a lot using virtual amiibos:\\n\\nUnlike other managers, Goldleaf checks the amiibo and attempts to get its picture from AmiiboAPI, otherwise displays a default icon.\\n\\nYou can change emuiibo's status (on, on for one use and off) and select a certain amiibo to use.\\n\\nv0.7.3\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nNow the console's supported key generation is read from BOOT0 (it was hardcoded manually before) - this means that Goldleaf won't have to be updated in new console updates to fix key mismatch errors! Thus, 9.0.1 support was also fixed.\\nUpdates\\n\\nGoldleaf's updater is broken on 0.7.2 (and probably lower versions). PLEASE, DON'T USE IT TO UPDATE TO 0.7.3!. Luckily, it is fixed for this version, so next versions (0.7.x, 0.8...) should download fine when they get released soon.\\n\\nPending update detection was barely broken, but has been fixed too. As mentioned in previous releases, you can export it to install it safely with ChoiDujourNX, and delete it from system after that.\\n\\nv0.7.2\\n\\nQuick bugfix\\n\\nv0.7.1\\n\\n9.0.0 support was added.\\n\\nIntroducing a new, properly made PC client: Quark! (since Goldtree was made as quick as possible, I've wanted to remake it from scratch since 0.1...)\\n\\nQuark is going to be Goldtree's new replacement.\\n\\nIt's Java and cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux and Mac.\\n\\nIt has a fancy, Material-style UI, which you can interact with while USB is handled in the background.\\n\\nNote that it's still experimental! You will need JRE/JDK 8u60 or higher to use it.\\n\\nConsole information layout has been remade into a new layout, introducing some new cool and QoL features:\\n\\nA new menu allows to view the current console update's version, plus an option to export it!\\n\\nIn case the console has a pending update downloaded (when the system auto-downloads an update) it can also be exported or removed, so that booting into Maintenance menu isn't neccessary to do so.\\n\\nUpdates can be exported in directory (to be later installed with Choi) or in NSP form.\\n\\nTitle exporting\\n\\nNSP generating code was rewritten from scratch, what might involve performance improvements.\\n\\nExported contents' directory was moved to /dump/title since update are exported to /dump/update\\n\\nv0.7.0\\n\\n===Remote PC===\\n\\nUnicode is now supported. No more complaints with special characters in drive labels or folders!\\n\\nRead size was dropped again to 8MB (from previous 16MB), to make USB more stable (16MB size might cause unstability)\\n\\nAdded option to select a file directly on the remote PC tool (basically same system as on <=0.5 Goldleaf versions, for those who like the classic system!)\\n\\nGoldtree's messages were slightly changed to be more accurate. Now it shows its version to avoid confusion between different executables.\\n\\n===NSP installs===\\n\\nThe NSP's name is shown above (instead of the directory).\\n\\nETA (estimated time for the install to finish) is now shown too.\\n\\nNow Goldleaf always obtains the NSP's key generation (previously only when it had a ticket) and compares it to a computed system one, in order to block installs with higher key generations (mostly since the contents couldn't be decryptable, thus utterly useless)\\n\\nNow install location is just chosen once, at the start of batch NSP installs (all NSPs within a directory)\\n\\nMulti-content installations (just a few titles currently) work now (didn't seem to work on 0.6.x)\\n\\n===Title dump / export===\\n\\nTitles are always dumped inside concatenation files (HOS's archive bit directories, used to support +4GB files), what means +4GB titles can safely be dumped on FAT32, and directly installed.\\n\\nFixed errors dumping updates and DLCs. They should work fine now.\\n\\n===General===\\n\\nA big part of the code was reformatted: several small bugs fixed, others not that small mentioned below.\\n\\nAdded a warning and success / failure messages for directory deleting.\\n\\nGoldleaf no longer relies on its custom libnx fork, since its only worthy difference was its (slightly) custom USB code, which has been merged in Goldleaf. This doesn't involve any performance changes, but less complexity in order to build the project.\\n\\nCopying files from PC to SD which are over 4GB is now correctly handled, creating a concatenation file (see above) to correctly handle it.\\n\\nThe forwarder was updated with hbloader's latest version, thus now the forwarder's version is 0.2.\\n\\n===User / accounts===\\n\\nUsers have a more important role in Goldleaf. Now an account has to be selected in order to use several user-related features.\\n\\nAdded support for unlinking (locally ONLY) accounts, mainly for banned people who want to unlink their accounts in order to delete them.\\n\\n===Content manager===\\n\\nFixed a bug where the base title's size would be shown always, even when checking only updates or DLC.\\n\\nAdded play statistics support, both for user-only (user must be selected first, see above) and global, this includes last played time and total play time for both.\\n\\nFixed bugs where contents whose base title is on a different location than updates/DLCs would be shown incorrecly.\\n\\n===UI===\\n\\nUnicode changes stated above\\n\\nThe system's shared font is no longer used, due to its lack of unicode characters. Instead, a new font is used from now on: Roboto (medium), aka Android's standard font.\\n\\nTwo new clickable icons have been added to the bottom right side of Goldleaf's top banner: one for user selection, while the other one for help and control information.\\n\\nSome small corrections made: size adjustments, with no connection no IP or default text will be shown from now on.\\n\\nPlutonium corrections with newlines and text sizes make dialog sizes more well measured now (previously, a single newline would make the dialog as wide as the entire screen)\\n\\nSeveral icon changes (forwarder's icon and amiibo dump), thanks to C4Phoenix for all his help with graphic resources since 0.1!\\n\\nGoldleaf now has been compiled with an experimental Plutonium branch which uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers aiming no memory leaks!\\n\\nNow, Goldleaf also supports dutch language! Thanks a lot to Mega for helping with the translation!\\n\\nv0.6.1\\n\\nFixed bugs present in 0.6:\\n\\n+4GB files are correctly handled now by the USB (remote PC) system\\n\\nNow Italian language works fine (strings were missing, what made Goldleaf insta-crash)\\n\\nInstalling a NSP to console memory would later open the file for hex viewing (now fixed and nothing else is done after install)\\n\\nNew features:\\n\\nInstall sizes (MB/s) are now accurately reported, with decimal values\\n\\nWeb browser can only be used launched from the forwarder (previously any application would work)\\n\\nThe forwarder was not updated. Goldtree received few string changes and more changes in order to fix +4GB file issues.\\n\\nv0.6\\n\\n(My god, it's been 4 months!)\\n\\nNSP installs:\\n\\nAs Goldleaf's internal filesystem handling has been completely remade, installs have been internally remade. This apparently results in slightly faster installs, at least in my case.\\n\\nNow the user won't be asked to ignore required firmware version or not, as that can be configured on the config.\\n\\nSleep-mode is disabled now in order to avoid to interrupt installs.\\n\\nNow all the NSPs inside a directory can be installed in a row (see below).\\n\\nUSB installs:\\n\\nUSB installs have been improved into a new feature: remote PC browser!\\n\\nNow you can directly browse your PC, plus any drives connected to it, as a regular filesystem, same as SD card or console memory.\\n\\nIt is also worth to mention that the new USB command system seems to be way, WAY more stable than any previous USB system in Goldleaf!\\n\\nAnyway, always keep in mind that it might freeze or cause bugs with folders with tons of files.\\n\\nFile systems:\\n\\nPresenting the new, remade USB system: remote PC browsing!\\n\\nInstead of a simple connection, it's a whole filesystem implementation over USB.\\n\\nBrowse your PC (Windows-only with Goldtree) directly from Goldleaf! Any extra drive inserted browsable by the PC will be browsable here.\\n\\nSince USB drives' support (fsp-usb service in Atmosphere) is still being worked on, you can use this system with drives inserted in your PC in order to browse or install files from there.\\n\\nTwo simple, QoL features have been added to filesystems (to directories in this case): the option to install all NSPs within the directory, and the option to set the archive bit on it.\\n\\nUI\\n\\nFor now on, Goldleaf main color will continue to be golden, but the \"secondary\" color along with gold is going to be blue.\\n\\nTherefore, both the icon and the main themes have been changed.\\n\\nGoldleaf auto-updating:\\n\\nNow Goldleaf supports updating itself, since https was supported on dkP. (this means direct access to GitHub for version checking and asset downloading)\\n\\nNevertheless, now Goldleaf's NSP is a forwarder, what means that just by updating the NRO you will target Goldleaf from HOME menu as always.\\n\\nYou can even upgrade the installed version if you want to!\\n\\nAs you may suppose, this requires internet connection :)\\n\\nAmiibo dumping support\\n\\nA new option has been added to the main menu, which adds support to dump real amiibos to be used with emuiibo.\\n\\nObviously, emuiibo 0.3 format is used. Please ensure you're also using the latest emuiibo version!\\n\\nv0.5\\nHuge UI refactor\\nUSB is in a better state now\\nNew and rebuilt content manager\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\nAtmosphère v0.8.3's new feature, payload rebooting from the console itself, is also supported by Goldleaf! Binary *.bin files will have an option to be launched as payloads if Atmosphère is detected running.\\n\\nThe old title manager has been refactored. Now, it can show ANY kind of content located in any partition, from system data archives to DLCs and updates, and regular titles. All of them can be removed individually.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability to detect the CFW currently running, which gets displayed on the CFW menu.\\n\\nNow the web browser is accessible even if Goldleaf isn't an installed title. It will use the WifiLogin web-applet, which has some limitations, but at least it's something.\\n\\nContent mounting (like NAND when being browsed or the NSPs when being installed) has been refactored to minimize any filesystem issues.\\n\\nSome icons were changed: NROs have a new icon, NCAs have now the old NROs icon...\\n\\nNSP exporting now warns with titles which are 4GB or higher, for risk preventing.\\n\\nUSB has been quite improved with experimental threads' syncing, which seems to make it more stable.\\n\\nRegular installs check for free size now.\\n\\nTickets show if they're used or not, so unused ones should be safe to remove.\\n\\nBoth USB and regular installations abort if the title is already installed.\\n\\nMinor fixes and corrections on texts and several options.\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nNow it's checked that the base folders inside \"sd:/goldleaf\" are created before entering certain menus.\\n\\nFile browsers won't refresh the current directory's contents after copying a file as it was pointless and caused delay.\\n\\nThis version of Goldleaf supports libnx v2.0.0, which fixed a few bugs with USB, and also added native keyboard support.\\n\\nNow files and directories can be renamed in file browsers using the native keyboard.\\n\\nNow new files or directories can be created (files will be empty) by pressing L (for files) or R (for directories) in a file browser.\\n\\nNow the star feature, NSP dumping! This is quite experimental though, and could be unstable. Be careful using it!\\n\\nAnother console memory partition can be browsed appart from the three others: PRODINFOF\\n\\nBrief information about the different partitions is displayed when selecting the console memory browser.\\n\\nThe path of the key file has been moved from \"sd:/goldleaf/\" to \"sd:/switch/\" as other homebrews use this path.\\n\\nAfter removing tickets no dialog will be shown, the footer will inform of the process instead.\\n\\nThe top part of Goldleaf has been redesigned, which has a mini-text for the current menu. (e.g. current directory in SD card or console memory browsers)\\n\\nA warning dialog is displayed selecting USB installation as it's quite unstable for the moment.\\n\\nFixed small bugs with SD card NSP installation.\\n\\nNow file/directory copying has a progress bar to follow the copy process, instead of freezing the UI.\\n\\nWEB BROWSER! Yeah, you've read right, Goldleaf is the first homebrew tool to provide support for the console's internal browser.\\n\\nAccount manager! You can replace user's icon, delete them or rename them. Anyway, replacing the icon can be dangerous and banbait!\\n\\nNow no cert files are required to install a ticket, not even with NSP installs or USB installs. Goldleaf contains the public cert directly.\\n\\nMinor fixes on several dialogs and texts.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nSupposedly, now those random crashes browsing menus or filesystems are fixed now.\\n\\nWhen looking for the key file for NCAs or themes, now more names are supported (not just keys.dat): keys.dat, prod.keys, keys.txt or keys.ini.\\n\\nFixed bug which would not install the selected theme if qlaunch was not extracted, and it would just extract it without processing the theme.\\n\\nNow title 0100000000001013 is installed to qlaunch directory, previously user page themes wouldn't work for this issue.\\n\\nv0.1\\n\\nFirst Release"
