  "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed.\\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.",

(commented out)\\nDid not want to remove this function, but because it only works with Nintendo controllers (and not Mission Control) it does seem somewhat redundant since the sync button on Nintendo controllers effectively turns off the controller as well.\\nIf it is highly desirable, I may include this command again in future revisions. But for size stability, I could not get it to fit properly this time around.\\nNumerous code optimizations and bug fixes.\\n\\n1.7.0\\n\\nNew memory expansion option (located in Settings > System).\\nThis function requires internet the first time it is ran, otherwise you can place nx-ovlloader.zip and nx-ovlloader+.zip in sdmc:/config/ultrahand/expansion/.
