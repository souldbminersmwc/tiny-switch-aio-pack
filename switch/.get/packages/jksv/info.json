  "changelog": "08/06/2024\\n\\nOops, I lied: Extra release edition.\\nThis release contains the following fixes and tweaks for Webdav:\\n\\nFixes empty file names on certain Webdav servers.\\nUses path safe titles for Webdav servers.\\nNOTE: This will cause an issue where this release of JKSV will target a different parent folder than the previous one for Webdav.\\n\\nAs with the previous, everyone should thank @rado0x54 for the Webdav support and fixes.\\n\\nHave a nice day everyone!\\n\\n07/18/2024\\n\\n(Experimental?) WebDav support thanks to @rado0x54. Instructions for using and setting it up can be found in Remote Instructions.\\nI'd also like to take this time to actually sincerely thank and apologize to @rado0x54. I didn't mean to ignore you or ignore your work and I really do think it's cool and appreciate it.\\n\\nThis will be the final release of JKSV until my work cleaning up and rewriting the code is finished. I wish I could freeze time and have it done overnight, but I can't. Thanks for being patient everyone.\\n\\n02/23/2023\\n\\nThis release contains a fix for the system font issues caused by the recent Switch update thanks to @SciresM.\\n\\nIt also forces me to post a release containing my in progress Google Drive code. Please note that while it works, I never had time to add and complete automatic upload/patching code. Uploading needs to be manually done for now. I promise I'll be back someday to finish it. You can read the instructions to set it up here.\\n\\nThere may be other changes I made in the past two years. If there are issues, report them and I'll do my best to figure them out when I can.\\n\\n-JK\\n\\n09/01/2021\\n\\nAdds Traditional Chinese support back thanks to @qazrfv1234\\nFixes output paths/title definitions not being read after initial import of old configurations\\nSeparates trash bin into sub folders so trashed backups aren't impossible to find.\\n\\n05/17/2021\\n\\nThe main reason for this update is to fix issues restoring New Pokemon Snap saves. Any new issues caused by the updated code to handle this can be reported. Other things since last time:\\n\\nUpdated Traditional and Simplified Chinese translation files.\\nNew sort options: Games can be sorted alphabetically, by play time, or by last played.\\nPaths to directories and files can be filtered from being backed up and deleted on restoring saves.\\nCreate a file named pathFilters.txt in the folder of the game you wish to filter files from. Add a file or folder for each line. For example, sv:/file.ext or sv:/directory for folders.\\nVarious other tweaks.\\nAny issues should be reported. I'll be working on expanding the New Snap container for expanded snap saves and keeping an eye out for issues I'm not aware of.\\n\\n06/07.2020\\n\\nTraditional and Simplified Chinese translations are included thanks to Leo and JamePeng\\nAny English strings leftover are my entirely my fault, but most of the UI is translated thanks to these two.\\nOutput folders used by games can be set by the user by creating a text file named titleDefs.txt and adding lines such as 01006C300E9F0000 = \"Dragon Quest XI S\". This is to help with folders that default to title ID because of unicode characters.\\nData loading has been reworked.\\nAll save data types should be supported now. The last three (System BCAT, Cache, and Temporary Storage) will only show if any data is found for them.\\nBlacklisted and unmountable titles are skipped sooner in loading, preventing JKSV from loading or creating icons for them.\\nFixed a memory leak where user icons weren't freed if titles were reloaded.\\nJKSV now has the option to backup and restore to and from ZIP archives.\\nJKSV can now write its own working directory to a ZIP archive that can be easily backed up and stored somewhere. (This is in the extra's menu).\\nNSP build is back for people who want it.\\n\\n05.20.2020\\n\\nHold time for confirmation is shortened. Options are added to completely disable it depending on what you want.\\nMinus and ZR are swapped for Options and Extras on the user selection screen\\nExploring the romfs of the title taken over by the homebrew menu is back in the extras menu.\\nSave Data can be erased from your system in the title selection screen like in the switch's settings menu. Holding A is required to confirm this.\\nA custom path for JKSV can be used by creating a file named jksv_dir.txt in your switch folder and typing the path you want to use. This must end with a /. For example, sdmc:/switch/.JKSV/ will make JKSV use a folder in the switch folder that is hidden from the hbmenu.\\nDump All can now be exited early by holding B until the current file is finished.\\nThe User selection screen has been changed to only show the maximum number of users instead of the title select's max of 32.\\nCertain strings can be translated with en-US.txt in JKSV's romfs. Naming this file trans.txt and placing it in JKSV's working directory will make JKSV load it instead of the default US text by myself. This is not 100% complete yet. Please wait if you're interested in making a translation to be included with JKSV in the future.\\nVarious new options.\\nTouch controls have been removed. Sorry.\\n\\n04.10.2020\\n\\nI wasn't planning this, but I've seen way too many people overwrite their ACNH saves with BCAT data and losing their progress.\\n\\nAdded Options Menu to User Select\\nOption one adds Device Saves to accounts when on. This is disabled by default.\\nOption two automatically creates a backup before restoring any save. These are automatically named starting with AUTO. This is enabled by default.\\nOption three is a small CPU overclock. This is to keep the text based UI mode running a bit smoother for people. This is disabled by default.\\nDeleting and Restoring saves now requires the user to hold A to 100% confirm they are sure they want to continue\\nUsers can now be changed in the title selection menu by pressing L or R.\\nTitles can now be favorited and pushed to the top of the title selection by pressing minus.\\nstdio is now used instead of C++ fstream and cuts down size about 200KB.\\nVarious changes and fixes.\\nThis is a prerelease. Parts of the UI's touch controls are not working correctly at the moment. I just don't want people accidentally losing their progress if I can help it.\\n\\n03.21.2020\\n\\nDev. Sv has been renamed Device and is moved higher up in the user select\\nJust a quick update for convenience since I'm going to be ripping apart Freebird's GUI and adapting it to JKSV as much as possible. I don't know how long this might take.\\n\\n01.06.2020\\n\\nSort of emergency release because of HID changes. Bug reports are appreciated. Changes since last year:\\n\\nEverything is enabled. You no longer need to hold a combo to enable:\\nSystem Saves\\nBCAT\\nDevice Saves\\nGeneric icons are generated for things without icons instead of using a big '?'.\\nUpdated for latest libnx\\nROMFS opening code has been removed until I have more time to remake it.\\nHopefully text mode loading is fixed\\n\\n\\n01/08/2019\\n\\nNew Icon thanks to @igniscitrinus\\nNSP Build\\nExtras menu is now accessible by pressing minus instead of button combo\\nExtra option added to delete downloaded update data and reboot console\\nTerminate Processes by titleID - For advanced users to explore normally unopenable system save data archives\\nLayout has been updated to resemble official Switch menus better\\nGraphics file updated for new libnx\\nAdded function to count directory sub dirs, files, and total size. Usable by selecting properties in Adv Mode on a directory.\\nSwitch Software Keyboard and dictionary support.\\n\\n09/15/2018\\n\\nBis storage exploration via Adv. Mode. Pressing ZL, ZR, and Y will activate this and take you to a different menu. All of the standard Adv. Mode options work here, but copying back to bis storage is disabled.\\nNAND Backup. I added this to experiment with FsStorage and stress test some things with larger files a week or two ago. I wouldn't use it as your only way to backup you NAND, but it is there.\\n\\n08/26/2018\\n\\nRewritten, more stable text-wrapping\\nEvery system font is now loaded\\nAdds title blacklisting. Pressing X in the title select will add the selected title to a list that prevents it from being shown. This is located at 'sd:/JKSV/blacklist.txt'\\nFile size is now displayed inside the progress bar\\nOther small tweaks\\n\\n08/05/2018\\n\\nShould fix games with non-ASCII titles. They will now default to their title ID.\\nTweaks some things related to strings.\\nAdds back the 3DS shortcut of holding L or R while selecting new to just auto name the backup\\nTitles are now sorted a bit better by using UTF8\\nThe input guide in the bottom right corner can now be used as button presses for touch controls. I still don't consider touch controls 100% complete\\nVarious UI tweaks and changes"
