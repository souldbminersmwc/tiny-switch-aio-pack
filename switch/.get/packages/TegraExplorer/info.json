  "changelog": "4.2.0\\n\\nThis update overhauls how system wipe's inside tegraexplorer are done. This should now fix the black screen on boot after performing a system wipe, and also save battery calibration values after a wipe.\\n\\nPlease report any issues in the Issues tab\\n\\nSystemwipe message has been edited to convey a bigger sense of danger when using the wipe script.\\nGenerate save index (#91, #96)\\nThis fixes the black screen issue\\nKeep the aging save (and index it) (#97, #99)\\nThis fixes battery issues after a system wipe\\nOn a lite system, this would have previously caused the battery to charge to unsafe levels. If you have previously ran the systemwipe script on a lite, you cannot run this script again to fix this.\\nMassive thanks to @JeffVi, who single-handedly fixed the systemwipe script\\n\\n4.1.1\\n\\nThis is actually just v4.1.0-b1, with 2 changes\\n\\n@bleck9999 added that the power and volume buttons can always be used as up/down/a\\nThe keyboard is also now fixed with just power/volume controls\\nThe firmwaredump script no longer automatically tries to read the firmware\\nPS: I messed up the selected branch of which this release is based, and i seemingly cannot edit this. it's based on this commit\\n\\n4.1.0-b1\\n\\nUpgrade BDK to Lockpick-RCM 1.19.10\\nNew keydump strategy, hopefully mitigating pkg1 hotfixes\\nThanks a lot to @JeffVi for helping me port the Lockpick_RCM BDK to TegraExplorer!\\n\\nThanks a lot to @lucasaf04 for testing this on an oled console for me\\n\\n4.0.1-hotfix4\\n\\nHotfix for key dumping on firmware 16.0.0, brought to you by @FlyingBananaTree! (again)\\n\\n4.0.1-hotfix3\\n\\nHotfix for key dumping on firmware 15.0.0, brought to you by @FlyingBananaTree!\\n\\n4.0.1-hotfix2\\n\\nThis is a hotfix to support fw 14.0.0, added by @dezem. Thanks!\\n\\n4.0.1-hotfix\\n\\nThis is a hotfix of TE 4.0.1 that contains the new PKG1 of 13.2.1. I'm still working on a proper release\\n\\n4.0.1\\n\\nFixes an error regarding broken error text output.\\n\\n4.0.0\\n\\nTegraScript v3!\\nEmbedded scripts!\\nThe firmware dump script has been replaced by an embedded script, which also shows the actual firmware version now!\\nA System wipe (factory reset) script is also embedded into TegraExplorer now\\nScripts put in sd:/TegraExplorer/scripts now show up in the main menu\\nCompiling with the SCRIPT_ONLY define will allow you to embed more scripts due to more space\\nProbably more that i forgot\\n\\nThis release wouldn't have been possible without the help of @bleck9999 and @maddiethecafebabe. Big thanks to them!\\n\\n3.0.6\\n\\nAdds support to dump keys on 12.1.0\\n\\nNote: this also implements lockpick_rcm's handling of future firmwares™️, so these support updates should be less frequent\\nUpdate bdk\\n\\nAdd payload compression\\n\\nShow a key dump error upon entering an mmc partition without dumping keys\\n\\nFix displaying small files in the hex view\\n\\n3.0.5\\n\\nSmall update to support key dumping on 12.0.2\\n\\n3.0.4\\n\\nThis is a small update to support 12.0.0\\nAlso gives out a nicer error message if pkg1 is unknown, rather than scary hex\\n\\n3.0.3\\n\\nAdded partition encrypting and decrypting. For the end user, this is only noticable in that prodinfo is now dumped decrypted. (and during restoring encrypted). WARNING: there is no option currently to restore an encrypted prodinfo part\\nShow SD mount error when user attempts to mount sd\\n\\n3.0.2\\n\\nUpdated bdk to hekate 5.5.2\\nFix up some broken code in the controller logic (switch lites should now not freak out anymore)\\nAdd a reboot normally option in the main menu\\nAdd safeguards for mariko to be unable to reboot to rcm\\nFix an issue where if too much data was read from the internal storage, invalid data would be returned\\n\\n3.0.1\\n\\nA charging icon has been added\\nScreenshots have been added\\nScript fixes (see the TegraScript Repo for more detail)\\nFile deletion now has a 500ms wait time\\nThis release of TegraExplorer runs a lot faster when you have minerva on your sd card.
